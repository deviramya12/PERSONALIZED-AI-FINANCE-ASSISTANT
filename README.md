# PERSONALIZED-AI-FINANCE-ASSISTANT
AI APPLICATION TO MANAGE YOUR FINANCE

Financial Forecasting and Analysis
## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for financial data processing, forecasting, and anomaly detection. It includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing of financial datasets

Machine learning models for financial prediction using XGBoost

Time series forecasting of budget using LSTM models

Anomaly detection for identifying unusual financial activities

Summary reports and visualization support for financial analysis

## Features
Train and save XGBoost models for financial data prediction

Load models to make predictions on new data

Perform budget forecasting with LSTM neural networks

Detect anomalies in financial data for fraud or error detection

Generate summary reports on financial status
